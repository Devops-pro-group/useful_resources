why do you work onsite?
 ###############################

There are several reasons why someone might choose to work on-site, rather than remotely. Some of the most common reasons include:

Collaboration: Working on-site can provide more opportunities for collaboration and face-to-face interactions with colleagues, which can lead to better communication and more efficient problem solving.

Focus and productivity: For some people, being in a physical office environment can help to eliminate distractions and increase focus, leading to higher levels of productivity.

Company culture: Some companies place a high value on maintaining a strong company culture, and believe that having employees physically present in the office is essential for achieving this.

Access to resources: Being on-site can provide easier access to resources such as technology, tools, and information that may not be as easily available when working remotely.
