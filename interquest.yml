Git: 

1. what is the difference between git pull and git clone
2. what is the difference between git pull and git fetch

3. what is staging area in git. :

R- These files are also referred to as "untracked files." Staging area is files that are going to be a part of the next commit, 
   which lets git know what changes in the file are going to occur for the next commit. The repository contains all of a project's commits.
   
4. what is git stash? :

R- The git stash command takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later use, and then reverts
   them from your working copy. It is used to back up 

5. what is reset in git? :

R- It is used to reset git or go back to your working area

6. What is the difference between HEAD and checkout in git :

R- Remember that the HEAD is Git's way of referring to the current snapshot. Internally, the git checkout command simply 
   updates the HEAD to point to either the specified branch or commit. When it points to a branch, Git doesn't complain,
   but when you check out a commit, it switches into a “detached HEAD” state.

7. Have you configured github repository locally

#############################################################################

What is your experience with Aws?:
R: I have experience on aws deploying a wordpress website that involve many aws service such as 
   Vpc with public and private subnet, security group, ec2 instance, Rds, EFS  and others
  - so i have been able to create a wordpress website that will be hosted in ec2
  - i have connected it with amazon RDS database
  - I have made it publicly accessible over the internet

  I have built a serverless web application on AWS using a bunch aws service like aws lambda,
    api-gateway, aws amplified. In that project our goal was to build and run an application 
    without have to manage infrastructure. That helps my company to reduce time to provision and maintaining
     infrastructure for our application.

Docker: is a software platform that allows you build , test, and deploy applications quickly.

 1. How you will build the your own docker images
 R-
Create a Docker image from an existing container: In this case, you start with an existing image,
customize it with the changes you want, then build a new image from it. 
Use a Dockerfile: In this case, you use a file of instructions — the Dockerfile — to specify the base image and the changes you want to make to it.
 
 2. How to find background process in docker containers
  R- docker ps -a 
  
 3. what is docker swarm
   A docker swarm : is comprised of a group of physical or virtual machines operating in a cluster. When a machine joins the cluster,
   it becomes a node in that swarm. The docker swarm function recognizes three different types of nodes, each with a different 
   role within the docker swarm ecosystem.
   
   How Does Docker Swarm Work? : 
   In Swarm, containers are launched using services. A service is a group of containers of the same 
   image that enables the scaling of applications. Before you can deploy a service in Docker Swarm, you must have at least one
   node deployed. 
   There are two types of nodes in Docker Swarm:

Manager node. Maintains cluster management tasks 
Worker node. Receives and executes tasks from the manager node
Consider a situation where a manager node sends out commands to different worker nodes.

Features of Docker Swarm
Some of the most essential features of Docker Swarm are:

Decentralized access: Swarm makes it very easy for teams to access and manage the environment 
High security: Any communication between the manager and client nodes within the Swarm is highly secure 
Autoload balancing: There is autoload balancing within your environment, and you can script that into how you
   write out and structure the Swarm environment 
High scalability: Load balancing converts the Swarm environment into a highly scalable infrastructure
Roll-back a task: Swarm allows you to roll back environments to previous safe environments

In summary, the main difference between both platforms is that Docker Swarm is lightweight and more beginner-friendly, 
while Kubernetes is heavy and complex. Developers looking for a middle ground might want to consider a new platform, K3s.
K3s eliminates the complexity of Kubernetes and provides a lighter, more accessible experience.

##############       Terraform
######################################################################

#1. What is terraform?

 Terraform is a popular open source Infrastructure as Code (IAC) tool that automates provisioning of your infrastructure 
 in the cloud and manages the full lifecycle of all deployed resources, which are defined in source code. Its resource-managing 
 behavior is predictable and reproducible, so you can plan the actions in advance and reuse your code configurations for similar
 infrastructure. It  facilitates the process of creating and deploying reusable and scalable infrastructure architectures.
 it helps to have a control over complete orchestration much like puppet and ansible.

#2. Why is terraform is used for Devops?

  - It can do complete orchestration and not just configuration management
  - It support of almost all the popular cloud providers like aws, azure, Gcp.
  - Easily manages the configuration of an immutable (dynamic) infrastructure
  - provide immutable infrastructure were configuration changes smoothly
  - works on HCL, which is a very easy to learn and understand
  - easily portable from one provider to another
  - easy installation 

#3. What is terraform init?

  terrafrom initializes the code using terraform init. It is ysed to initializethe working directory
  containing terraform configuration file. The command will install plugins, install child modules and backend 
  initialization

#4. How does terraform works?

  terraform has a lifecycle to create resource 
   - terraform init : used to create an operational directory
   - terraform plan : implements an execution plan
   - terraform apply : ensures that the plan is set in motion in the time-frame
   - terraform destroy : used to eliminate all the applied resources  
   

#5. define null resource in terraform

  null_resource implements standard resource library. But no futher action is taken.
  The triggers argument allows an arbitrary set of values that will cause the replacement of resources when changed.

#6. How to check the install version of terraform ?

To check the version do 
terraform --version

#7. What is a provider in terraform? Enlist some terraform providers

  Terraform provider is responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources.
  Providers generally are an Iaas (aws,gcp, azure), or Saas services (terraform cloud, cloudfare),
  Paas (heroku).

#8. What  is a modules in terraform?

  A module is a container for several resources that are used together. The root module is compulsory
  for every terraform that includes resources mentioned  in the tf files.

#9. what is the remote backend in terraform?
